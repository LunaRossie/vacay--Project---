## Description

Ruff Life Adoption Center is a non profit and charitable organization. We rescue pets from overcrowded shelters; pets who are relinquished by their owners as well as to rehabilitate animals who have suffered cruelty and neglect. We envision a world where all animals have a home with the love and quality care they deserve and where the human-animal bond thrives. We will save thousands of animal lives each year to strive and nurture humane treatment of companion animals across the country.
